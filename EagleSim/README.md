# EagleSim: A simulation framework to study placement and control of PTZ cameras in photo-realistic virtual worlds.

Here, we provide two different ways to use EagleSim.
 1. Using pre-compiled binaries: This is a slightly easy way to set up the PTZ camera abstractions and get going.
 We provide pre-compiled binaries for vehicle tracking and human tracking scenarios.
 The pre-compiled binaries are tested on Ubuntu 18 and Ubuntu 20. If this doesn't work in your operation system set-up, we recommend compiling the binaries using source code for your desired operating system configuration. 



 2. Compiling the source code. We provide the source code of the virtual world built over Unreal engine that creates vehicle tracking and human tracking scenarios. This source code can be used to compile the desired binaries.
