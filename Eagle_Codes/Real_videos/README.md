# Simulating PTZ actions on real videos
In this folder, we show the transfer of trained Eagle policies from pure simulation
to the real videos.

## The notebooks for two videos used in the paper are provides
- *Simulate_PTZ_Video.ipynb* and *Simulate_PTZ_Video2.ipynb*
- Both notebooks have comments explaining the process.
- The last cell visualizes the entire scene and PTZ view as action from Eagle policies
are transferred to the bounding box of the video when tracking the vehicle.
